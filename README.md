# VIS147A
A project that could've gone better.

Yeah so there were supposed to be four components to this project: an audio speaker, a pushbutton, an lcd and a stepper motor.
It was all working at one point, at least the code was but the hardware had some issues as soon as I got to soldering in the connections,
particularlily with the LCD display.
